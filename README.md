# ReactTwoAssignment

PseudoCoding the assignment portions because I was unable to complete the assignment.

## Components
The Components I would use to complete the assignment would be as follows:

- a component to handle the scrape feature meaning it takes inputs such as key words, and years. I would have an Ajax call in this component that runs after a click event. This will scrape the New York Times API and return articles 

- Another component to take the information that is scraped and transform that into JSX to be displayed on the page. This will make up the results screen

- The state of the results screen will change as articles are scraped and information is pulled. The SEARCH button will tbe the event that leads to change of state and pull new data

- Each result will have a save button. This component will save the article information in a database. Once an article is saved, the SAVED Article component will update showing the articles the user has saved.

- There will be another component that will enable users to click the saved articles and add notes which can all be saved in a database.

- a component to pull stateless component where all other components will be rendered.
